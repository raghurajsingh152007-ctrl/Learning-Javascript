🚀 JavaScript Learning Journey
Welcome to my JavaScript repository! I am an aspiring developer currently documenting my progress as I master the fundamentals of JS.

📚 What I've Learned So Far

1. Variables & Data Types
   Understanding how to store and manipulate data is the foundation of everything.

Variable Declaration: Mastered let, const, and the differences between them (and why we generally avoid var).

Data Types: Explored Primitives like Strings, Numbers, Booleans, Null, and Undefined.

2. Objects & Key-Value Pairs
   I’ve moved into more complex data structures to represent real-world entities.

Object Syntax: Learned how to group related data using {}.

Properties: Understanding how Keys and Values work together.

Accessing Data: Using Dot notation and Bracket notation to retrieve information.

🛠️ Current Projects
Practice Exercises: Small scripts testing variable manipulation.

Mini-Object Models: Creating objects to represent things like user profiles or gaming stats.

📈 Next Steps
[ ] Arrays and Methods

[ ] Functions and Scope

[ ] DOM Manipulation (Making things interactive!)

🚀 Today's Progress
Today, I dived deeper into JavaScript fundamentals to strengthen my logic-building skills for web development. I focused on how data is manipulated and how programs make decisions.

🧠 Concepts Covered
Operators:

Arithmetic ( +, -, \*, /, % )

Assignment ( =, +=, -= )

Comparison ( ==, ===, !=, >, < )

Logical ( &&, ||, ! )

Conditional Statements:

Writing if, else if, and else blocks.

Understanding truthy and falsy values.

Using switch statements for cleaner multi-condition logic.

📝 Overview
Today I focused on mastering the fundamentals of Strings and Loops. These are essential building blocks for any developer, especially when it comes to handling data and automating repetitive tasks.

💻 Key Concepts Learned
Strings: Understanding how to manipulate text, including indexing, slicing, and common string methods.

Loops: Implementing for and while loops to iterate through data structures and control program flow efficiently.

Integration: Combining loops with strings to perform operations like character counting and text reversal.
